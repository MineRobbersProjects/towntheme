title: Announcing: tilde.town theme for Jekyll
---

Exactly as it says on the tin. This uses the default tilde.town css to theme your town-related blog.

A few possibly asked questions pre-emptively answered:  
* The horizontal rules on the index page are made using &lt;hr noshade&gt;
* The CSS is the theme generally applied to new tilde.town pages.
* You can edit the CSS from the CSS structure in `_config.yml` (namely, the background color and font family)
* The name is changed using the `name` tag in `_config.yml`.
* The url/baseurl for tilde.town usage would be as such:

    ```yaml
    url: "https://tilde.town"
    baseurl: "/~username"
    ```
